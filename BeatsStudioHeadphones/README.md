This a single-page static website of the Beats 3 Studio Headphones made to practice my skills in web development.

The website contains 4 sections:

-  Home
   -  Introduction of the product
   -  Sponsors of the headphones
-  Specs
   -  List of features included in the headphones
-  Case
   -  Description of the case offered along with the headphones
   -  Discount offered while purchasing now through the website
-  Products
   -  Selection of the different style of Beats 3 headphones that you can choose
   -  Contact section included below ( This should be an individual section. I will learn from this and make a designated contact section in my future projects.)
